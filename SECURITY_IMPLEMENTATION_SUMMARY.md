# Jewelry Security Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security improvements applied to the Jewelry project, based on the security implementations from PathCast project.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Security Headers Middleware

- **SecurityHeadersMiddleware**: Adds comprehensive security headers to all responses
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Prevents XSS attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: Enforces HTTPS (when enabled)
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser features

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeadersMiddleware.php`
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` (added to global middleware)

### 2. Input Sanitization Middleware

- **InputSanitizationMiddleware**: Sanitizes all incoming request data
- **XSS Protection**: Removes malicious scripts and HTML
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Blocks common SQL injection patterns
- **Recursive Sanitization**: Handles nested arrays and objects
- **Null Byte Removal**: Prevents null byte injection
- **Whitespace Normalization**: Cleans up excessive whitespace

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/Http/Middleware/InputSanitizationMiddleware.php`
- `app/Http/Kernel.php` (added to API middleware)

### 3. Audit Trail System

- **File-based Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail using Laravel's logging system
- **AuditTrailMiddleware**: Automatically logs all API requests with execution details
- **AuditTrailHelper**: Core helper class for audit trail functionality
- **Log Retention**: Configurable log retention (default: 90 days)
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Automatically redacts sensitive fields

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `app/Http/Middleware/AuditTrailMiddleware.php`
- `app/Helpers/AuditTrailHelper.php`
- `config/audit.php`
- `config/logging.php` (added audit channel)

### 4. Enhanced CORS Security

- **Restricted Origins**: Only allowed origins can access the API
- **Method Restrictions**: Limited to necessary HTTP methods
- **Header Restrictions**: Only necessary headers allowed
- **Security Configuration**: Configurable through security config

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Middleware/ImageCorsMiddleware.php`

### 5. Authentication Security

- **Audit Logging**: All authentication events are logged
- **Failed Login Tracking**: Failed login attempts are logged with IP addresses
- **Token Management**: Previous tokens are deleted on new login
- **Password Security**: Strong password requirements maintained

**Files Modified:**
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/AuthController.php`
- Added audit trail logging to all auth methods

### 6. Security Configuration

- **Comprehensive Security Config**: Centralized security settings
- **Environment-based Configuration**: Flexible security settings
- **Password Policy**: Configurable password requirements
- **Session Security**: Secure session configuration
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limiting settings

**Files Created:**
- `config/security.php`
- `config/audit.php`

## Security Middleware Stack

The following middleware is now applied to all API requests:

1. **SecurityHeadersMiddleware**: Security headers
2. **ThrottleRequests**: Rate limiting
3. **InputSanitizationMiddleware**: Input sanitization
4. **AuditTrailMiddleware**: Audit logging
5. **SubstituteBindings**: Route model binding

## Logging Configuration

### Audit Log Channel

- **Driver**: Daily rotation
- **Path**: `storage/logs/audit.log`
- **Retention**: 90 days (configurable)
- **Level**: Info (configurable)

### Logged Events

- All API requests and responses
- Authentication events (login, logout, registration)
- Failed authentication attempts
- Database queries (when enabled)
- Execution times and performance metrics

## Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Security Configuration
SECURITY_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_CSP_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_HSTS_ENABLED=true

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true
API_RATE_LIMIT=60
AUTH_RATE_LIMIT=5
LOGIN_RATE_LIMIT=3

# Audit Trail
AUDIT_TRAIL_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_LOG_CHANNEL=audit
AUDIT_LOG_LEVEL=info
AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS=90

# CORS
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:4000,http://localhost:3000
ADMIN_APP_URL=http://localhost:4000

# Password Policy
PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH=8
PASSWORD_REQUIRE_UPPERCASE=true
PASSWORD_REQUIRE_LOWERCASE=true
PASSWORD_REQUIRE_NUMBERS=true
PASSWORD_REQUIRE_SYMBOLS=true
```

## Testing the Implementation

### 1. Verify Audit Logging

Check that audit logs are being created:

```bash
tail -f storage/logs/audit.log
```

### 2. Test Security Headers

Check that security headers are present:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:8000/api/
```

### 3. Test Input Sanitization

Send malicious input and verify it's sanitized:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"<script>alert(1)</script>","email":"test@test.com","password":"Test123!"}'
```

### 4. Test Rate Limiting

Try making multiple requests to see rate limiting in action:

```bash
# Test login rate limiting
for i in {1..5}; do curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login; done
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Comprehensive Logging**: All user actions are tracked and logged
2. **Attack Prevention**: XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF protection
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents brute force and DoS attacks
4. **Input Validation**: All input is sanitized before processing
5. **Security Headers**: Browser-level security protections
6. **Audit Trail**: Complete audit trail for compliance and debugging
7. **Performance Monitoring**: Request execution times are logged

## Maintenance

### Log Rotation

Audit logs are automatically rotated daily and old logs are cleaned up based on the retention period.

### Monitoring

Monitor the audit logs regularly for:

- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Performance issues
- Security violations

### Updates

Keep the security patterns in `InputSanitizationMiddleware` updated as new attack vectors are discovered.

## Conclusion

The Jewelry application now has enterprise-level security features that protect against common web vulnerabilities while maintaining comprehensive audit trails for compliance and debugging purposes. The implementation follows Laravel best practices and is easily configurable through environment variables.

## Security Features Comparison
